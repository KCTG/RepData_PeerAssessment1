## Loading and preprocessing the data
## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document for the activity monitoring assignment. This records all steps in reproducing answers to all questions in this assignment.

We first load data of all the activities from October to November 2012. In this code chunk, NA's are also omitted from the data set:
```{r activity}
activity <- na.omit(read.table("repdata_activity/activity.csv", sep = ",", header = TRUE))
```
*Ensure that you have set the correct working directory*

Convert date format
```{r}
activity$date <- as.Date(activity$date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r q1}
steps.day <- activity %>% group_by(date) %>% summarise(total.steps = sum(steps))
hist(steps.day$total.steps, main = "Total Steps per Day")
abline(v = median(steps.day$total.steps), col = "blue", lwd = 3)
abline(v = mean(steps.day$total.steps), col = "yellow", lwd = 2, lty=3)
legend(x = "topright", c("Median", "Mean"), col = c("blue", "yellow"), lwd = c(3,2), lty = c(1,3))
```

Mean:
```{r echo=FALSE}
mean(steps.day$total.steps)
```
Median:
```{r echo=FALSE}
median(steps.day$total.steps)
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?
```{r q2}
avg.per.interval <- activity %>% group_by(interval) %>% summarise(mean.per.interval = mean(steps))
with(avg.per.interval, plot(interval, mean.per.interval, xlab = "Interval", ylab = "Average steps per interval", type = "l", main = "Average daily pattern"))
abline(h = max(avg.per.interval$mean.per.interval), lwd = 2, col = "red")
legend(x = "topright", c("Max"), col = c("red"), lwd = c(2))
```

Max: 
```{r echo=FALSE}
max(avg.per.interval$mean.per.interval)
```


## Imputing missing values
```{r imputed.data}
activity.w.na <- read.table("repdata_activity/activity.csv", sep=",", header = TRUE)
sum(!complete.cases(activity.w.na$steps)) # Count of incomplete cases
md.pattern(activity.w.na) #check missing data
mice.plot <- aggr(activity.w.na, col = c("blue","red"), numbers = TRUE, sortVars = TRUE, labels = names(activity.w.na), cex.axis = .7, gap = 7, ylab = c("Missing Data", "Pattern")) #visualize pct of missing data 
activity.imputed <- mice(activity.w.na, seed = 500) #impute data, using defaults
activity.imputed.complete <- complete(activity.imputed, 3) #completed data, choosing 3rd data set
steps.day.complete <- activity.imputed.complete %>% group_by(date) %>% summarise(total.steps = sum(steps))
hist(steps.day.complete$total.steps, main = "Total Steps per Day")
abline(v = median(steps.day.complete$total.steps), col = "blue", lwd = 3)
abline(v = mean(steps.day.complete$total.steps), col = "red", lwd = 2, lty=3)
legend(x = "topright", c("Median", "Mean"), col = c("blue", "red"), lwd = c(3,2), lty = c(1,3))
```

Mean with imputed data:
```{r echo=FALSE}
mean(steps.day.complete$total.steps)
```
Median with imputed data:
```{r echo=FALSE}
median(steps.day.complete$total.steps)
```

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
```{r q3}
wkdays <- c("Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday","Friday")
activity.wday <- activity.imputed.complete %>% mutate(wkday = factor((weekdays(as.Date(date)) %in% wkdays), levels = c(FALSE, TRUE), labels = c('weekend', 'weekday')))
avg.steps.wday <- activity.wday %>% group_by(wkday, interval) %>% summarise(mean.wday = mean(steps))
qplot(interval, mean.wday, data = avg.steps.wday, geom = "line", xlab = "Interval", ylab = "Number of Steps", facets = wkday ~ .)
```
